\StartLetter{}{Dear editors of the \emph{Journal of Statistical Computing and Simulation},}

We are resubmitting our manuscript "Adaptive Hybrid Screening for Efficient Lasso Optimization" for your consideration as an original paper for publication in the *Journal of Statistical Computing and Simulation*.

Our revised manuscript addresses all of the issues raised during peer review. In particular, we now include an appendix with a more detailed accounting of the algorithms' performance in terms of number of post-convergence checks and proportion of features screened for all four of the real data sets considered in Section 5.2. Our point-by-point response to reviewer comments is included along with revised manuscript.

Thank you very much for the opportunity to revise and resubmit our manuscript.  We feel that several improvements have been made to the original version and hope that you agree.
